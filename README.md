The main file used to run my program is EightPuzzle.java
This is the file that you will need to compile and run in order to
use the program.

The Node.java file is used to model a Node object and is 
utilized as a helper class in the main class, as mentioned above.

Compile all the java files in the directory using: javac *.java
Then run the main file using: java EightPuzzle

Run the main file, EightPuzzle.java and you will be greeted 
with a command line interface. You will interact with the menu 
options.

You can follow the menu from this point on.

Thank you,
Abraham Yepremian
